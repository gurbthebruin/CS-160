1. Then, download the RSat SAT solver from (http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/rsat/).
Read the manual/README carefully. Use RSat to solve the SAT instance
obtained above. Is the instance satisfiable?

RSat returns that graph1.txt is unsatifiable with only 3 colors, but when I ran it with 4 colors, it turns out to be satisfiable. 


2. Do the conversion again, this time, with 4 colors. Use RSat to solve this new SAT
instance. Is the instance satisfiable?

With the 4 color conversion, RSat claims that this new SAT insance is satisfiable. 

3. What do the answers of these two SAT instances tell you about the graph
coloring problem of the above graph? Can you give a solution (a coloring) to
the graph coloring problem of the above graph based on the results of RSat?

This means that the highest degree node is 4, which is why there must be atleast 4 colors in order to solve this problem. 

A potential solution would be: 

1: Orange
2: White
3: Orange 
4: Green
5: Blue
6: White 
7: Green


4. Now, use a similar approach to solve the graph coloring of the graph described in
graph2.txt. What is the minimum number of colors required to properly color
this graph?

For graph2.txt, the graph is unsatifiable with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 colors, but is satisfiable with atleast 8 distinct colors.
